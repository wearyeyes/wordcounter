# wordcounter

This is my first big (actually small :)) program on GitHub. Wordcounter read a text file and count a number of unique words. 

Program works in terminal. You can write name of the needed file on argument of command line or if you don't do this program ask you the name of file (just a name in the same directory or path to the file). Then it writes to standard output all finded unique words in decreasing order.

This program needs to be improved in the future.
